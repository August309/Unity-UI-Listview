Unity UI Listview
===================

Here's a demonstration of a listview for Unity's new UI. Provides a sortable 
list view interface for Unity's new UI system. The columns are type aware such 
that the numerical values, datetimes, and timespans can be intelligently sorted. 
The row selection is configurable such that one, many or no rows can be selected 
using mouse clicks or shift+click for selecting multiple rows. The manager 
exposes an OnSelectionEvent to which other scripts can subscribe.
